# Post #1 - Motivation

A while ago I found the YouTube channel [NesHacker](https://www.youtube.com/@NesHacker) which has a few cool videos mainly about the NES, but recently he postet a video about [Game Boy Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luBSm1SbR7g)
which got me interested in the matter.

I started off with the [GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) so I could code in C since I'm more familiar with that then GBZ80 assembly and was actually astonished on how easy it was to code a fully working game (which I may upload at a later point).

While it was a nice experience, games for the black/white Game Boy always feel a bit cold and so I wanted to add a bit more color to it which is why I opted to proceed with the GCB.
Moreover, using assembly instead of C hopefully gives me a bit more insight on the Game Boy hardware - not that I need it, coding on such an old system is mainly for fun and won't give me any new knowledge for my daily coding problems.
