# Post #2 - Understanding the *'Color'* in Game Boy Color

From coding for the classig Game Boy (DMG), I had a somewhat good understanding on how tiles, backgrounds, sprites, the pallette and all that works,
but to make the next step on utilizing the GBC, I had three problems right from the start:

- First, I had only used [GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) so far, which does most of the musclework for you in highlevel C and so I had to find a good source of example code in assembly
- I couldn't get the assembler to produce a usable cartridge file (even if I just copy-pasted a very simple cartridge)
- I did not quite understand on how the GBC color pallettes work
