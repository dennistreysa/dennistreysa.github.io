# Intro
On this blog I will mainly write a bit about my project [railblocks](https://github.com/dennistreysa/railblocks), a game for the Game Boy Color written in GBZ80 assembly as some sort of [rubberducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and maybe to be useful for others seeking information about the GBS.
